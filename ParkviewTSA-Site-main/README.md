# Parkview TSA Website

Welcome to the Parkview TSA website repository! This README provides an overview of the project, including setup instructions, design guidelines, and best practices for maintaining the website.

## Overview

The Parkview TSA website serves as a hub for information about the Parkview Technology Student Association (TSA). It includes various sections such as officer profiles, upcoming events, and club information.

## File Structure

Most of the website’s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are contained in the `/public` folder. Use this as the base directory for development and deployment.

## Color Scheme

The website uses the following color scheme:

- **Black:** #10182B
- **Orange:** #EE7B19
- **White:** #FFFFFF

## Image Optimization

To ensure fast loading times and better performance, follow these guidelines for image optimization:

1. **Compress Images:** If images slow down the website, compress them using [Image Compressor](https://imagecompressor.com/).
2. **Officer Photos:** For individual officer photos, set the quality to around 30. This ensures they look good while staying under 300kb in size.
3. **Loading Speed:** Aim to keep all images optimized to improve page load times.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tsaparkview/ParkviewTSA-Site.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd parkview-tsa-site
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   If we do add APIs and Packages run this in the terminal.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   
**To push or pull code follow basic instructions and avoid conflicts.**

## Usage

- **HTML Files:** Located in the `/public` directory. Update content and structure here.
- **CSS Files:** Style adjustments can be made in the CSS files within the `/public` directory.
- **JavaScript Files:** For interactivity and functionality, edit the JS files located in the `/public` directory.

## Repository

Keep commits clean and easy to read as multiple people will be working on it.

## Contact

For any questions or issues, talk to Ms. Calvert or ParkviewTSA.
