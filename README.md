Parkview TSA Website

Most HTML, CSS, and JS files are contained in the /public folder, so use it as the base directory.

Color scheme for main parts: #10182B for the black, #EE7B19 for the orange, and white

If images ever make the website slower go to https://imagecompressor.com/ and compress them. For individual officer photos, make the quality around 30 (it will still look good trust me). Try to make the images under 300kb IF they change loading speed.
